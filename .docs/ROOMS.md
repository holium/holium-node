# Rooms

Dedicating an entire doco to rooms since it's a major aspect of the node.

### Notes App

When a note creator leaves their notes room:

- the room should not be destroyed
- the room should remain open until all note participants have left the room
- the notes room should not interfere with "regular" (interactive) rooms
- notes rooms should be generalized to background rooms
- future use-cases include the "is typing" animations in chat

To get out of a Notes room (per Trent):

- Click the Note you are currently in
- Select a different note in the Notes sidebar
- Close the Notes app
